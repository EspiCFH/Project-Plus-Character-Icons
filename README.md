# Project-Plus-Character-Icons
A repository that has all the different character icons portraits and stocks, etc. Doesn't include secret costumes because they don't have full data.
I originally created this for my spreadsheets and thought it'd be useful to other people too.
All of the assets come from the P+ 2.5.2 Modder's Pack, they're simply renamed to make them easily searchable

There are 3 different types of icons:
1. stock - A character's stock icon
2. portrait - Appears to the left of the stocks; The inbetween of stock icon and full render
3. full - A character's entire render

Costumes are numbers by the amount of times you would press X on a gamecube controller to access a costume
so for example, if you would press X 5 times, the costume would be in Character Icons\{character}\{stock/portrait/full}\5.png
